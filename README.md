github-blog
===========

Blog builds content by github repository (written in spring mvc, groovy). Example: [http://dimafeng.appspot.com/](http://dimafeng.appspot.com/)

Originally it was desined for [Google AppEngine](http://appengine.google.com) but you can use it in any servlet container.

All content stored in git-hub repository (for example you can see to my [blog structure](https://github.com/dimafeng/blog-data)).
